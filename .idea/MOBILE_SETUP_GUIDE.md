flutter devices

# Check for emulators
flutter emulators

# Check Flutter doctor
flutter doctor
```

## 📱 **Mobile App Features**

Your app includes these mobile-specific features:

3. Sync when connection restored

## 🚀 **Quick Commands**

```bash
# Run on default device
flutter run

# Run on specific device
flutter run -d <device-id>

# Run on web (current working version)
flutter run -d chrome

# Build APK for distribution
flutter build apk

# Build iOS app (Mac only)
flutter build ios
```

## 📊 **Device Compatibility**

Your app works on:
