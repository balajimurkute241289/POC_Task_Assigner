flutter devices
```

### 5. **Set Up Mobile Emulators**

**Android Emulator:**
1. Open Android Studio
2. Go to Tools ‚Üí AVD Manager
3. Click "Create Virtual Device"

3. Go to Xcode ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Components
4. Download iOS Simulator
5. Open Simulator app

### 6. **Run the Demo App**

Once everything is set up:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd frontend

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on Android emulator
flutter run

# Run on iOS simulator (macOS only)
flutter run -d ios

# Run on web browser
flutter run -d chrome

# Run on connected device
flutter run -d <device-id>
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"flutter command not found"**
   - Make sure Flutter is in your PATH
   - Restart your terminal/command prompt
